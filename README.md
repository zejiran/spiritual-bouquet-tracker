# Spiritual Bouquet Tracker

💐 A digital tool for managing collective spiritual offerings and prayers. Built with React, TypeScript, and Cloudflare Workers, it allows groups to track masses, rosaries, and other spiritual offerings in real-time.

## What is a Spiritual Bouquet?

A spiritual bouquet is a collection of prayers, sacrifices, and good works offered for someone's intention. It's like giving someone a bouquet of flowers, but instead of physical flowers, you're offering spiritual gifts like Masses, rosaries, fasting, and other devotions.

## Features

- Create spiritual bouquets for individuals or intentions
- Track different types of offerings (Masses, rosaries, fasting, holy hours, etc.)
- Share unique links to allow others to contribute their offerings
- View summaries and statistics of all contributions
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Wrangler CLI (`npm install -g wrangler`)
- Cloudflare account

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zejiran/spiritual-bouquet-tracker.git
   cd spiritual-bouquet-tracker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create `.env` files:

   For the server (in `/server` directory):

   ```
   # No environment variables needed for local development
   ```

   For the web (in `/web` directory):

   ```
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8787/api
   VITE_IMGBB_API_KEY=your_imgbb_api_key
   ```

   > Note: To use image uploads, you'll need to sign up for a free [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com/) account and get an API key.

4. Start development servers:

   Start both frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or start them individually:

   ```bash
   # Frontend only
   npm run dev:web

   # Backend only
   npm run dev:server
   ```

## Deployment to Cloudflare

### 1. Prepare your Cloudflare account

1. [Sign up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) for a Cloudflare account if you don't have one
2. Install the Wrangler CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   ```
3. Login to Cloudflare:
   ```bash
   wrangler login
   ```

### 2. Deploy the database

1. Create a D1 database:

   ```bash
   cd server
   wrangler d1 create spiritual-bouquet-db
   ```

2. Note the database ID from the output and update the `wrangler.toml` file:

   ```toml
   [[d1_databases]]
   binding = "DB"
   database_name = "spiritual-bouquet-db"
   database_id = "your-database-id"
   ```

3. Apply the schema:
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 execute spiritual-bouquet-db --file=./schema.sql
   ```

### 3. Deploy the backend API

1. From the server directory, deploy the worker:

   ```bash
   cd server
   wrangler deploy
   ```

2. Note the API URL (e.g., `https://spiritual-bouquet-api.username.workers.dev`) for frontend configuration

### 4. Deploy the frontend

1. Create a `.env` file in the web directory:

   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://spiritual-bouquet-api.username.workers.dev/api
   VITE_IMGBB_API_KEY=your_imgbb_api_key
   ```

2. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages:

   ```bash
   cd web
   wrangler pages deploy ./dist
   ```

3. In the Cloudflare Pages dashboard, add the environment variables:
   - `VITE_API_URL=https://spiritual-bouquet-api.username.workers.dev/api`
   - `VITE_IMGBB_API_KEY=your_imgbb_api_key`

### 5. Configure CORS

1. Update the CORS headers in `server/src/index.ts` to match your frontend domain:

   ```typescript
   const corsHeaders = {
     "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "https://your-frontend-domain.pages.dev",
     // ...other headers
   };
   ```

2. Redeploy the server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   wrangler deploy
   ```
